**#Project 2**

**Temperature Converter**

This is a simple Python program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. It takes the unit and value as input, applies the correct formulas, and outputs the equivalent values in the other two units. This project helped me practice user input, conditional statements, and formatting results in Python.
